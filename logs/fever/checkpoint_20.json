Studios comic series of the same name. The character has also appeared in the spin-off series Angel, as well as numerous expanded universe materials such as novels and video games. Buffy was portrayed by Kristy Swanson in the film and by Sarah Michelle Gellar in the television series.

Emphasizing the distance between God and mankind, revelation-based belief-systems require angels to bridge the gap between the earthly and the transcendent realm.[6] Angels play a lesser role in monistic belief-systems, since the gap is non-existent. However, angelic beings might be conceived as aid to achieve a proper relationship with the divine.[7]. Abrahamic religions describe angelic hierarchies, which vary by religion and sect. Some angels are indicated with names (such as Gabriel or Michael) or are of a specific kind or rank  (such as a seraph or an archangel).\n"

It is the eighth-most populous city in the U.S. and second-most populous city in California with a population of over 1.4 million, while the San Diego metropolitan area with over 3.3 million residents is the 18th-largest metropolitan area in the nation. San Diego is the county seat of San Diego County.[17] It is known for its mild Mediterranean climate, extensive beaches and parks, long association with the United States Navy, and recent emergence as a wireless, electronics, healthcare, and biotechnology development center.. Historically home to the Kumeyaay people, San Diego has been referred to as the Birthplace of California, as it was the first site visited and settled by Europeans on what is now the West Coast of the United States.[18] In 1542, Juan Rodr\u00edguez Cabrillo claimed the area for Spain, forming the basis for the settlement of Alta California, 200 years later.\n"

It is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built, and is the largest standing amphitheatre in the world. Construction began under the Emperor Vespasian (r.\u200969\u201379\u00a0AD) in 72[1] and was completed in AD 80 under his successor and heir, Titus (r.\u200979\u201381).[2] Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian (r.\u200981\u201396).[3] The three emperors who were patrons of the work are known as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named the Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin: Amphitheatrum Flavium; Italian: Anfiteatro Flavio [a\u0271fite\u02c8a\u02d0tro \u02c8fla\u02d0vjo]) by later classicists and archaeologists for its association with their family name (Flavius).. The Colosseum is built of travertine limestone, tuff (volcanic rock), and brick-faced concrete. It could hold an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 spectators at various points in its history,[4][5] having an average audience of some 65,000;[6] it was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles including animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, dramas based on Roman mythology, and briefly mock sea battles.\nThought 2: Thought 1: I should search for the Colosseum.\nAction 1: Search[The Colosseum]\nObservation 1: The Colosseum is a tourist attraction in Rome, Italy.\nThought 2: Given that it's a well-known landmark in Rome and it was built during Roman times, it is likely that Nikolaj Coster-Waldau worked with the Italian public broadcasting company RAI (Radiotelevisione Italiana).\nAction 2: Search[Rai]\nObservation 2: Could not find [Rai].

Proponents of Thatcherism are referred to as Thatcherites. The term has been used to describe the principles of the British government under Thatcher from the 1979 general election to her resignation in 1990.[1] In international terms, Thatcherites have been described as a part of the general socio-economic movement known as neoliberalism, with different countries besides the United Kingdom (such as the United States) sharing similar policies around expansionary capitalism.[2]. Thatcherism represents a systematic, decisive rejection and reversal of the post-war consensus inside Great Britain in terms of governance, whereby the major political parties largely agreed on the central themes of Keynesianism, the welfare state, nationalised industry, and close regulation of the British economy before Thatcher's rise to prominence. Under her administration, there was one major exception to Thatcherite changes: the National Health Service (NHS), which was widely popular with the British public.[3] In 1982, Thatcher promised that the NHS was \"safe in our hands\".[4].\n"

James VI and I (James Charles Stuart; 19 June 1566 \u2013 27 March 1625) was King of Scotland as James VI from 24 July 1567 and King of England and Ireland as James I from the union of the Scottish and English crowns on 24\u00a0March 1603 until his death in 1625. Though he long attempted to get both countries to adopt a closer political union, the kingdoms of Scotland and England remained sovereign states, with their own parliaments, judiciaries, and laws, ruled by James in personal union.. James was the son of Mary, Queen of Scots, and a great-great-grandson of Henry VII, King of England and Lord of Ireland, and thus a potential successor to all three thrones. He acceded to the Scottish throne at the age of thirteen months, after his mother was forced to abdicate in his favour.\nThought 2: Thought 1: I should check James VI's birthdate for verification.\nAction 1: Lookup[James VI and I birthdate]\nObservation 1: The exact date of birth is not recorded on the page.\n\nThought 2: Considering that birthdates are typically public information, this claim seems plausible.\nAction 2: Search[Jams of Scotland]\nObservation 2: Could not find Jams of Scotland.
